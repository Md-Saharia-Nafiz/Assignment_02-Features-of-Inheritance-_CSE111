This assignment applies friend functions along with four features of inheritance in C++. It also demonstrates the use of inheritance through the diamond problem and a payroll system.



## Description:

This assignment explores the powerful concept of inheritance in C++ programming.
It covers four key features of inheritance, providing a clear understanding of each.
Friend functions are applied to showcase their interaction with inherited classes.
The assignment addresses the diamond problem, highlighting challenges in multiple inheritance. 
A practical payroll system is implemented to demonstrate real-world use of inheritance.
Overall, it offers a comprehensive look at how inheritance enhances code reusability and organization.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used in Features of Inheritance:

(i) Base Class & Derived Class:
The foundation of inheritance where a derived class inherits properties and methods from a base class.

(ii) Access Specifiers (Public, Protected, Private):
Control how members of the base class are accessible in derived classes.

(iii) Single, Multiple & Multilevel Inheritance:
Different types of inheritance showing how classes can inherit from one or more base classes.

(iv) Overriding & Polymorphism:
Allows derived classes to redefine base class functions to provide specific behavior.

(v) Friend Functions:
Special functions that can access private or protected members of a class.

(vi) Diamond Problem:
A scenario in multiple inheritance where ambiguity arises due to repeated inheritance of a base class.
## Features of Inheritance (C++):

✅ Code Reusability:
* Inheritance allows a class to reuse code from another class, reducing the need to write duplicate code.

✅ Hierarchy:
* It creates a parent–child (base–derived) relationship among classes, making program structure clearer.

✅ Extensibility:
* New classes can be created from existing ones with added features or functionalities.

✅ Access Control:
* Public, Protected, and Private inheritance control which members of the base class can be accessed by derived classes.

✅ Overriding & Polymorphism:
* Derived classes can redefine base class functions to change behavior as needed.

✅ Multiple Inheritance & Diamond Problem:
* A class can inherit from multiple base classes, which may sometimes cause ambiguity or duplicate member issues.

✅ Friend Function Interaction:
* Friend functions can access private or protected members of derived classes, allowing controlled interaction.
## 🔔 Purpose of Features of Inheritance in C++:

1. Code Reusability:
* Reduce redundancy by reusing existing class properties and methods in new classes.

2. Organized Hierarchy:
* Establish a clear parent–child relationship among classes for better program structure.

3. Extensibility:
* Allow creation of new classes with added features based on existing classes.

4. Access Control:
* Control how base class members are accessed by derived classes using public, protected, or private inheritance.

5. Polymorphism Support:
* Enable derived classes to override base class functions and provide specific behavior.

6. Problem Solving (Diamond Problem Handling):
* Manage complexities in multiple inheritance, such as ambiguity or duplicate members, using virtual inheritance.

7. Practical Application:
* Implement real-world systems like payroll, employee management, and other hierarchical structures efficiently.
